### foofactors package

The `foofactors` package has 3 functions and this is a demo of how the functions work.

```{r}
#install_github("jokagyeman/foofacotrs")
library(foofactors)
```
The first function is `fbind` which puts two factors together as one.

```{r}
#Here is an example,

fbind(iris$Species[c(1,51,101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1,11,21)])
```

The second function is `freq_out`, which gives you a dataframe with factors and their frequency.

```{r}
# Here is an example

freq_out(iris$Species)

```

The third function is `f_keep`, which keeps factor levels as they are in the r object.

```{r}
sons <- factor(c("John", "Caleb", "Joel"))
f_keep(sons)
```
